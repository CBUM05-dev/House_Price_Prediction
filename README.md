# House Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts house prices based on various features. The dataset used is the famous **California Housing Dataset**. The notebook walks through the entire process of building a regression model â€” from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all code and explanations.
  
## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict median house values in California districts based on features such as:
- Median income
- House age
- Average number of rooms and bedrooms
- Population
- Location (longitude and latitude)

## Model Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**

## Features & Steps

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
-  **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
-  **Feature Scaling**
-  **Model Training**
-  **Model Evaluation** 
-  **Hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearchCV

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
